**Electrical Engineering Student at UFMG (Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais)**

Hello! I'm Arthur Reis, a passionate **Electrical Engineering** student at UFMG, Brazil, with a strong interest in **Machine Learning (ML)**, **Deep Learning (DL)**, and **Data Engineering**. I started my journey in 2023 working with statistical software during my **Scientific Initiation** at **CDTN (Centro de Desenvolvimento de Tecnologia Nuclear)**. Since then, I‚Äôve been dedicating time to advancing my knowledge in these fields.

I have experience with a variety of traditional **Machine Learning models** such as:
- **Linear Regression**
- **Logistic Regression**
- **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**
- **Bayes Classifier**
- **Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM)**
- **Kernel Density Estimation (KDE)**
- **Neural Networks**

I have also explored **Unsupervised Learning algorithms**, including:
- **K-Means**
- **Expectation Maximization (EM)**
- **t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE)**
- **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)**

My primary focus has been on **Computer Vision** and **Spatial Models**, particularly with **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)**. Some of the projects I‚Äôve worked on include:
- **Disease prediction models**
- **Autonomous driving simulator**
- **Pest identification in agriculture**

In addition, I‚Äôve delved into **Sequential Models** such as **RNNs**, **LSTMs**, and **GRUs**, and have completed projects like **stock market predictions**. Recently, I‚Äôve been studying **Generative AI** and neural architectures like **Transformers** and **BERT**.

I'm deeply curious and enthusiastic about learning and contributing to the world of technology. Below are some of my projects.
